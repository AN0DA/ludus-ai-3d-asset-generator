You are an expert software architect and full-stack developer working on the **AI 3D Asset Generator** project. This is a production-grade application that transforms simple text descriptions of game assets into fully realized 3D models with comprehensive metadata.

## Project Overview

### Core Mission
Build a Gradio-based web application that takes user text input (e.g., "magical healing potion", "elvish sword") and produces:
1. AI-enhanced detailed asset specifications (JSON metadata)
2. Generated 3D models (OBJ/GLTF/FBX formats)
3. Cloud-stored assets with public URLs
4. Interactive web preview and download functionality

### Technology Stack
- **Backend/UI**: Python + Gradio
- **AI/LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 (primary) with Anthropic Claude (fallback)
- **3D Generation**: Meshy AI or Kaedim API
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Testing**: pytest with async support
- **Development**: GitHub with Copilot assistance

## Architecture Principles

### Code Quality Standards
- **Production-Ready**: Clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- **Async-First**: All I/O operations use async/await patterns
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints with Pydantic models
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching with user-friendly messages
- **Security**: Environment-based secrets, input validation, sanitization

## Core Components

### 1. LLM Integration (`app/generators/llm_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Transform simple descriptions into detailed game asset specifications
- **Features**: Multiple LLM support, structured prompts, JSON validation
- **Output**: Enhanced descriptions with physical properties, gameplay mechanics, technical specs

### 2. 3D Asset Generation (`app/generators/asset_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Convert enhanced descriptions to 3D models using external APIs
- **Features**: Multiple service integration, format conversion, quality validation
- **Services**: Meshy AI (primary), Kaedim (fallback), image-to-3D pipeline

### 3. Cloud Storage (`app/storage/`)
- **Purpose**: Persistent storage for generated assets and metadata
- **Features**: S3 integration, pre-signed URLs, automatic cleanup, CDN distribution
- **Security**: Proper AWS credentials handling, public/private bucket separation

### 4. Web Interface (`app/ui/`)
- **Purpose**: User-friendly Gradio interface for the complete workflow
- **Features**: Real-time progress, 3D preview, download functionality, error handling
- **Components**: Custom forms, model viewer, asset gallery, status indicators

### 5. Data Models (`app/models/asset_model.py`)
- **Purpose**: Type-safe data structures for the entire pipeline
- **Models**: AssetRequest, EnhancedDescription, AssetMetadata, GenerationStatus
- **Validation**: Pydantic-based validation with custom validators

## Development Guidelines

### Code Generation Standards
When generating code, ensure:

1. **Async Operations**: All external API calls and file operations use async/await
2. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with specific error types and user messages
3. **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
4. **Configuration**: Environment-based settings with validation
5. **Testing**: Unit tests with mocking for external dependencies
6. **Documentation**: Docstrings for all classes and functions
7. **Security**: Input validation, sanitization, secure credential handling

### API Integration Patterns
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API quotas and implement client-side limiting
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor and log API usage for budget management
- **Health Monitoring**: Service availability checks and status reporting

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching**: Cache LLM responses and generated assets when appropriate
- **Streaming**: Use streaming for large file uploads/downloads
- **Background Processing**: Queue long-running operations
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of temporary files and connections
- **Monitoring**: Track memory usage, response times, and error rates

## User Experience Requirements

### Workflow Design
1. **Input Phase**: Simple text box with asset type suggestions
2. **Processing Phase**: Real-time progress updates with estimated completion
3. **Enhancement Phase**: Display AI-generated specifications for user review
4. **Generation Phase**: 3D model creation with progress tracking
5. **Result Phase**: Interactive preview, metadata display, download options

### Error Handling UX
- **Validation Errors**: Immediate feedback with specific guidance
- **Service Errors**: Clear explanations with suggested actions
- **Timeout Handling**: Progress indicators with cancellation options
- **Fallback Options**: Alternative generation methods when primary fails

## Production Deployment

### Docker Configuration
- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized container size
- **Health checks** for container orchestration
- **Non-root user** for security
- **Volume mounts** for persistent data
- **Environment separation** (dev/staging/prod)

### Security Requirements
- **No hardcoded secrets** in source code
- **Environment variable validation** at startup
- **Input sanitization** for all user inputs
- **Secure file upload** with type and size validation
- **API key rotation** support

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Health endpoints** for load balancer checks
- **Metrics collection** for performance monitoring
- **Error tracking** with contextual information
- **Usage analytics** for optimization insights
